      "message": "Why don\u0027t we introduce transactional BatchRefUpdate in global-refdb ?\nShould be rather simple to implement at least for the implementations which are based on a database system (aws-dynamodb-refdb, spanner-refdb).\n\nAnother option would be to revert the succeeded ref updates which are part of the local BatchRefUpdate in global-refdb. This would require that we cache the old values of those refs until we know if the overall update succeeded or failed.",

The description is really good I think, summarises the issue very well ðŸ˜Š\n\n+1 from me - someone who knows the library better than me can +2 this.",
