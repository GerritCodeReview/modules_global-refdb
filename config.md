global-refdb Configuration
=========================

Configuration should be specified in the `$site_path/etc/<libModule>.config` file of
the libModule consuming this library.

## Configuration parameters

```ref-database.enabled```
:   Enable the use of a global refdb
    Defaults: true

```ref-database.storeAllRefs```
:   Enable storing all refs
    Default: false

    The default behavior is to exclude draft comments, immutable non-meta refs,
    and cache-automerge refs, while storing remaining refs.

    When `storeAllRefs = true`, all refs will be stored in the ref-database.

```projects.pattern```
:   Specifies which projects should be validated against the global refdb.
    It can be provided more than once, and supports three formats: regular
    expressions, wildcard matching, and single project matching. All three
    formats match case-sensitive.

    Values starting with a caret `^` are treated as regular
    expressions. For the regular expressions details please follow
    official [java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/).

    Please note that regular expressions could also be used
    with inverse match.

    Values that are not regular expressions and end in `*` are
    treated as wildcard matches. Wildcards match projects whose
    name agrees from the beginning until the trailing `*`. So
    `foo/b*` would match the projects `foo/b`, `foo/bar`, and
    `foo/baz`, but neither `foobar`, nor `bar/foo/baz`.

    Values that are neither regular expressions nor wildcards are
    treated as single project matches. So `foo/bar` matches only
    the project `foo/bar`, but no other project.

    By default, all projects are matched.
